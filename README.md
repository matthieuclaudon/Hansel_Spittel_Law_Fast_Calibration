This code allows a fast calibration of the **Hansel & Spittel** material behavior law with a flat tensile specimen. Two formulations of this law are proposed:
* The original formulation.
* The FORGE (Transvalor) formulation.
You can choose to take into account or not the LÃ¼ders bands, if there are. You can decide on which part of the curve to make the identification.
